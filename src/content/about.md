# who is rom.io?

<img width="200" class="profile right-picture" alt="a picture of Romeo" src="/romeo.jpeg" /> you've probably figured it out already, but this website is about the guy on the right, which is me, i am Romeo

i am a full time dad & husband, full time dev and full time superhero <sup>(hey, there's 24 hours in a day, ok?)</sup>

i have been a code slinger for around 15 years now, though i have only been paid to do it full time for about 10

lately i’ve been focusing more on **typescript** based ecosystems (**react**, **react-native**, **node.js** etc.) sprinkled with a bit of **golang** on the side and **c** when i’m playing with MCUs

i like **aws** a lot, i also like **gcp**, probably each for different reasons

currently i work at [truepill](http://truepill.com) as a senior swe, leading a team of other code slingers like me. in the past i've worked in other places, you can find the list [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/romeobalta/) or in [my resume](/resume) if you're interested in that i guess

i love mentoring and sharing knowledge with people that are at the beginning of their swe journey

i've built the keyboard that i currently use on my own. it is split into 2 halves of 18 keys each and it helps me sling code faster and with less typos

_**note:** while i enjoy working with some languages and technologies more than others, they are just tools, like my keyboard. proficiency with tools comes with just using them. it's far more important for a swe to focus on improving their ability to analyse a problem, deconstruct it into requirements and challenges then use critical thinking to find creative solutions to satisfy the requirements and overcome the challenges_
