# website.dev

This is kind of like a theme for a personal website of a somebody that writes code. It's built using [astro](https://astro.build/), [react](https://reactjs.org/) and [tailwind](https://tailwindui.com/) and deployed on [netlify](https://netlify.com/).

If you want to use it, use it. Consider leaving the links in the footer so others can find it's source too.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ content/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ posts/
â”‚           â””â”€â”€ post-1.md
â”‚           â””â”€â”€ post-2.md
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ about.md
...
```

Both the about text and the blog posts are built from `.md` files. The about page is generated from `src > content > about.md` and the posts are create from the files inside `src > content > posts`. Then name of the file will become the `url` of the post.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

These are [astro](https://astro.build/)

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command           | Action                                       |
